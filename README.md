Pupose of Project:
The purpose of the project was to create a usable product for a consumer for a Human Interface 
Design Class. This was created with a team of 4 individuals who where not all programmers. Together, 
we had to create a project and determine if it was usable for an indidual without instructions. To do 
this, we first made the project Starving Steve and then did a case study to determine its usablity. 

Description of Project:
The project is a game in which the user has to jump from platform to platform collecting different foods
to gain energy. The game ends if either Steves starves or falls off a platform.  

Areas of Improvement:
There could have been better instructions for the collecting of powerups and an AI could be implemented.
